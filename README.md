# bb-bot

Project 6 for the class "TDT4113 - Computer Science, Programming Project" at NTNU. The task at hand was to build a behaviour-based robot. I wrote code to simulate input and behaviour to avoid lenghty debugging on the physical robot (a raspberry pi with different sensors). The resulting code was then run on the robot with real sensors and produced the expected behaviour.

The files "camera.py", "ultrasonic.py", "reflectance_sensors.py", "zumo_button.py" and "motors.py" were given as part of the assignment. I have modified most of these to reduce the amount of unused code in the files, as well as optimizing the transition from simulation to real-life behaviour.
