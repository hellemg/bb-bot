# bb-bot

Project 6 for the class "TDT4113 - Computer Science, Programming Project" at NTNU. The task at hand was to build a behaviour-based robot. I wrote code to simulate input and behaviour to avoid lenghty debugging on the physical robot (a raspberry pi with different sensors).

The files "camera.py", "ultrasonic.py", "reflectance_sensors.py", "zumo_button.py" and "motors.py" weere given as part of the assignment. I have modified some of these slightly.
